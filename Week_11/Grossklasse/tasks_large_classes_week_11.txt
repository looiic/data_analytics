Tasks: 

1.) The exercises in this large class are designed to deepen understanding of the word embedding concept.
    The example shows how neural networks can be used to train models for word embeddings and predictions 
    of target words of a text corpus. Note that knowledge about the functionality of neural networks 
    is not part of the written exam.

2.) Try to run the Jupyter notebook and understand what the Python code is doing.

3.) Learn how text data is prepared, and how neural networks can be used to create word embeddings and to predict
    target words based on continuous bag-of-words (CBOW).
