Tasks:

1.) Import the car data set 'autoscout24_data_prepared' from Moodle.
    Create a subset of cars with fuel type 'Benzin' and 'Diesel'.
    Perform one-hot encoding of the categorical variable 'Fuel_Type'.
	Create train and test samples (80% train, 20% test).

2.) Fit a multiple linear regression model with:
    'Price_num' = target variable
	'Mileage_num' = explanatory variable
	'HP_num' = explanatory variable
    'Fuel_Type' =  explanatory variable
    
	Evaluate the model using suitable goodness-of-fit measures.
	Check model residuals graphically.

3.) Fit a random forest regression model with:
    'Price_num' = target variable
	'Mileage_num' = explanatory variable
	'HP_num' = explanatory variable
    'Fuel_Type' =  explanatory variable

	Evaluate the model using suitable goodness-of-fit measures.
	Check model residuals graphically.
	Evaluate feature importance.
